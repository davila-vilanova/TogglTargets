Easier to use spawning - collection ops
if SpawningOperation knows about the NetworkRetrieveProjectsOperation, it knows about the corresponding CollectionOperation and it might know about the corresponding OutputModel (if possible to access from generic type).
With that knowledge it could receive the collection closure along with the spawning closure. Or it could receive a maker of the collection operation. Use a maker (factory) instead of the operation spawner.
